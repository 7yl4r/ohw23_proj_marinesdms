Bioclim - good teaching tool for looking at presence data for species distribution modeling.

Basically, you just need to get a set of predictor raster sets for climate variables and a data frame containing species observation points as input (presence points). It creates a Bioclim model from it and stores it in a variable bc.

You can then plot the raster and raw values.

```{r}
require('dismo')
bc <- bioclim(predictorRasters, observationPoints)

pb <- predict(predictorRasters, bc)
plot(pb, main='Bioclim, raw values')
```
