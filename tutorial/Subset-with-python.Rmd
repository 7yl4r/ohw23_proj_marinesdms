```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

# Second approach. Use Python from R

From the terminal window, do
```
conda create -n xarray xarray netcdf4 zarr
```

Now we can use Python and xarray in R. We can use 
```{r}
library(reticulate)
use_condaenv("xarray")
xr = import("xarray")
xr$open_dataset("/home/jovyan/shared/marine-SDMs/INDIAN_OCEAN_025GRID_DAILY.zarr")
```

You can also run python like so
```{python}
import xarray as xr
```


## Create rasters for R

Somehow. I don't know reticulate.

```{r}
# load packages  
library(sf) 
library(ncdf4)
library(raster)
library(rasterVis)
library(RColorBrewer)
```
