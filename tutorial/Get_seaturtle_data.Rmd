Use these examples to get some sea turtle data for 2000 to 2023
https://eeholmes.github.io/Species-Dist-Modeling---Trillium/observation-data.html

You might also look for OBIS data:

```{r}
# lon, lon, lat, lat
ext <- raster::extent(41.875, 65.125, -0.125, 32.125)
```

Columns to get. Others? Gender?

```{r}
# select columns
    colsWeNeed <- c("species", "lat", "lon", "locality", "year", 
        "coordinateUncertaintyInMeters", "occurrenceID", "occurrenceRemarks", 
        "geodeticDatum")
```

Get a data frame of loggerhead sea turtle data

```{r}
spp <- "Caretta caretta"
loggerh <- dismo::gbif("Caretta", species = "caretta", 
        nrecs = 300, geo = TRUE, removeZeros = TRUE, ext = ext)

```

## To do

* Get more sea turtle data
* plot the data
* find the turtles that are at sea and not on land
* add a column for "on land" so we can analyze those separately
